Elderly individuals encounter difficulties in managing daily tasks, particularly related to 
medication, emergency contacts, and communication with caregivers. These challenges arise 
due to a lack of user-friendly tools. VitalEase aims to provide a solution by offering an 
intuitive web platform that enables the elderly to easily handle medication schedules, access 
emergency contacts, and communicate with caregivers. It also includes remote monitoring 
features, allowing authorized individuals to oversee the well-being of the elderly from a 
distance.
